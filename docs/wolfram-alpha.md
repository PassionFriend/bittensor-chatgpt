# Wolfram Alpha Plugin

Use the Wolfram Alpha API to access a vast database of knowledge and computational abilities in your Chatbot UI.

## How To Enable

1. Sign up for an API key at [WolfarmAlphaAPI](https://account.wolfram.com/).

2. Once you've created an account visit at [WolframAlphaDeveloper](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/access)

3. Get an APP ID creating the application with the "Full Results API" selected, you'll be provided with an API key, often referred to as the "APP ID." This key is crucial for accessing the Wolfram Alpha API.

4. Add the obtained API key to your `.env.local` file.

## How It Works

1. The Wolfram Alpha plugin allows you to retrieve answers and perform computations based on natural language queries.

2. By integrating the Wolfram Alpha API into your Chatbot UI, you can provide users with instant access to a wealth of knowledge and mathematical capabilities.

## Usage

1. Install the Wolfram Alpha plugin in your project.

2. Access the plugin in the search tools dropdown of your Chatbot UI.

3. Input your natural language query, such as mathematical equations, factual questions, or data analysis tasks, to receive immediate answers and computations.

## Note

The Wolfram Alpha API may have usage limits based on your subscription. Please refer to Wolfram Alpha API documentation for more details.

Enhance your Chatbot UI with the power of Wolfram Alpha's knowledge and computation abilities!
